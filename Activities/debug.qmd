Please help me with the below code. I need to submit this paper ASAP but I'm just starting to learn R and don't know exactly what to do. I appreciate it.

Best,\

```{r}
bool = true
priNt(bool)
```

```{r}
bool*45LL

trueish = Log(45) == log(45)
```

```{r}
Nums1 = seq(trueish:5).

Nums2<-SEQ(5:truefish)
```

```{r}
plot(X;y)
```
